React Application deployment in Container


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl wget git nginx

Install Node.js (for building React app):
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

                 To Download the react files from git or we can use the local storage 
                 
Example: git clone https://github.com/your-repo/react-app.git
cd react-app
npm install
npm run build
After we run the build command it will create a folder build
then we need to copy the inside of the folder to /var/www/html/

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reactapp
the above command is to used to change the configuration file in ngnix the code is below
server {
    listen 80;  # this have to list the port number
    server_name _;

    root /var/www/reactapp;   # this command is path of the application 
     index index.html;        # name of the .html application 

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}

Enable the reactapp configutration file the below command
                 
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reactapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

                 
                 
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/reactapp
sudo cp -r build/* /var/www/reactapp/

systemctl restart nginx

and also we can deploy with different different port number with creating the file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/(any-name)
