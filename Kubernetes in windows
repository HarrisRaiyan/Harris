for minikube installations directly can use the steps given in official website.
for checking the node the command is kubectl get node
for detail information of node command is kubectl get node -o wide

to check the running pods in client machine (kubectl get pod) it shows only defult namespace pods only
first create a pod.yaml file with required pods 
then for creating the pod command is (kubectl apply -f pod.yaml)
kubectl describe pod (podname) to show full details of pod
kubectl get namespace this command while shop the namespace in cluster.
when we not mention the namespace in pod.yaml file this will create in defult namespace there are 4 namespaces
defult
kube-node-lease
kube-public
kube-system
for checking which are the pods are running in which namespace the command is (kubectl get pod -n (name of the namespace))

for creating a namespace command is (kubectl create ns (name))

in kube-system the every master pods are running like api scheduler controller manager and etcd this everything is created as dedult under namespace kube-system.

when we create a cluster in aws using kops for installation kops we can get in offical page cammond and there will be two nodes(nodes means one system or server) first  node is master node that have the control of every work node and master node is having the pods under which api ,scheduler ,controller manager and etcd.
every pod is created in work node
kubectl delete pod (name of the pod)
to check the details of replicaset command is (kubectl get replicaset)
to check the namespace of the pod with full details vommand is ( kubectl get pod -n (namespace) -o wide 
for same describe (kubectl describe pod -n (namespace) (podname))
to check running daemonset command is(kubectl  get deamonset -n (namespace))

to delete the deployment command is (kubectl delete -n (namespace) --all or can mention the name of the deployment
to delete the replicaset this is the same for both replicaset and daemonset
to delete the namespace command is ( kubectl delete ns (name))
for checking the service of the pod (kubectl get svc)
for login into the pod command (kubectl exec -it podname /bin/bash)
